"Face_emotion_recognition" Project is my Graduation Project. The application of FER-model can recognize Facial-expression in picture and real-time.

This Project include:

Using Tensorflow,keras... to train Fer2013 data, the training model (Accuracy-rate：66%) is saved as fer2013lyx66.h5.
Coding with Python and Opencv (Haar classifier), the Face-recognition Project can mark faces in real-time accurately and return the predicted Facial-emotion class and probability.
You can download the project, configure the environment，run with Pycharm.
